# Mod-1-Project

This goal of this project was to make recommendations to a new division of the Microsoft company, Microscoft Entertainment Studios, for breaking into the movie industry.

This group project utilized webscraping, data cleaning, and some elimentary data analysis to conclude that certain genres allow for a higher profit margin, and that investing money into big name actors and directors is a good allocation of resources to insure a productions future popularity and acclaim.

Our presentation is located in branch "dave" and is titled "Microsoft Entertainment Studios2".
